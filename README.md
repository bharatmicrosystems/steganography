# Steganography
This is a Java application which can embed simple messages into images using the principle of steganography.
It uses the Least Signification Bit algorithm to achieve it. This method employs modifying the LSB of the pixels to embed the message within the image. This methods is useful in lossless image formats such as PNG or BMP but cannot tolerate compression.

It is a fun hobby project and can be used freely as desired.
